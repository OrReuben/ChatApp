## Why did I make it?

1. This project was created in order to self-educate myself on how to use sockets, and transfer information in real time.
2. As I was studying sockets, I came up with an idea to make a discord-like platform for people all over the world to be able to communicate
with one another, in a simplistic chat.
3. Many of the chat applications and websites today use a lot of different tools that usually most people don't even need, which causes it to
be harder to understand and use in first glance. I recreated a chat that overcomes these problems and his main and only goal is - chatting!

## What are my tools?

1. You'll be able to register and login, and create a unique awesome avatar for yourself!
    
2. You'll be able to sort through all of the different accounts that exists on the website and find your friends!

3. You'll be able to add new friends and get friend requests from other users!

4. You'll be able to get notifications about how many people added you, and decide if to accept the friend request or decline it.

5. You'll be able to chat with your friends only, and incase someone got you mad, you can also remove him from your friends!

6. All of the messages are saved to a server, and the theres beautiful, easy to use UI for any user to the tiniest devices!
